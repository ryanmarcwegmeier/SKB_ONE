credentials for using slack API
Setup:
the access token is generated by a slack app that gets the necessary scopes
the app has to subscripe to the event listener which needs to send a 'challenge' variable to the route "/messages/events"
in order to initiate. See the comment in the route.
for testing with localhost you can use ngrok.
